TODO.txt for a rough plan for what needs to be done here.

==Installation==

===Prerequisites==


Ruby with Gem support
Sqlite3

On OS X with Snow Leopard and developer packages, everything builds as is.

On Linux, to build gems, you need devel packages for:

sqlite3, curl, libxml2, libxslt


===Installation tasks===
gem install rails mongrel

cd nhin-d-rest/rails
rake gems:install
rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
script/server -d
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:load
rake test

Application comes with interactive user forms as well as API approach.

To use the interactive app, you'll need to create some users at:

http://localhost:3000/users/new

===NGINX Configuration===

The client certificate security model was tested with nginx. The particular SSL configuration used (in addition to the standard nginx SSL and proxy configurations) was (in the listen directive):

ssl_protocols           TLSv1;
ssl_session_cache		shared:SSL:10m;
ssl_verify_client	    on;

Note that the session cache is required due to an nginx bug with no session cache.

In the location directive:
proxy_set_header  SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY   $ssl_client_verify;

=Overview=

All the juicy bits are in routes.rb, messages_controller.rb, statuses_controller.rb, statuses.rb, and messages.rb
Security code is in application_controller.rb

Full integration tests in test/integration/messages_test.rb
